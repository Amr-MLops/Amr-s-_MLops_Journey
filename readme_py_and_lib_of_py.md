# 🐍 Python & Data Libraries

This folder contains my progress in Python programming and essential data science libraries. It serves as the foundation for my MLOps career path.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered:
- **Core Python**: Variables, Data Types, and Logic.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, Dictionaries, and advanced Indexing.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Classes, Inheritance, and Decorators.
- **Data Libraries**: 
  - **NumPy**: Numerical operations and Array handling.
